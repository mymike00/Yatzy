"<i>Yatzy/Kniffel</i> is a game where you roll five dice and try and make "
"sets that score points. The goal is to get the highest score.<br/><br/>The "
"game is made up of 15 turns in Yatzy or 13 turns in Kniffel. A turn starts "
"by rolling all five dice. You can re-roll some or all of the dice up to "
"twice. Select dice to stop them from being re-rolled.<br/><br/>Points are "
"scored by summing the dice that make each set. The following sets are "
"possible.<br/><i>Ones</i>: Dice showing the number 1.<br/><i>Twos</i>: Dice "
"showing the number 2.<br/><i>Threes</i>: Dice showing the number 3.<br/"
"><i>Fours</i>: Dice showing the number 4.<br/><i>Fives</i>: Dice showing the "
"number 5.<br/><i>Sixes</i>: Dice showing the number 6.<br/><i>Bonus</i>: If "
"the above sets score at least 63 points (an average of three dice in each "
"set) then a bonus of 50 points (Yatzy) or 35 points (Kniffel) is given.<br/"
"><i>One Pair (Yatzy only)</i>: Two dice showing the same number (largest "
"pair used).<br/><i>Two Pairs (Yatzy only)</i>: Two pairs of dice.<br/"
"><i>Three of a Kind</i>: Three dice showing the same number. In Yatzy the "
"eyes of equal dice are sum up, in Kniffel all eyes.<br/><i>Four of a Kind</"
"i>: Four dice showing the same number. In Yatzy the eyes of equal dice are "
"sum up, in Kniffel all eyes.<br/><i>Small Straight</i>: 1 to 5 in any order -"
"> 15 points (Yatzy), row of four in any order -> 30 points (Kniffel).<br/"
"><i>Long Straight</i>: 2 to 6 in any order -> 20 points (Yatzy), row of five "
"in any order -> 40 points (Kniffel).<br/><i>House</i>: A pair and a three of "
"a kind sum up (Yatzy), -> 25 points (Kniffel).<br/><i>Yatzy</i>: All five "
"dice showing the same number (worth 50 points).<br/><i>Chance</i>: All dice "
"used for scoring.<br/><br/>You must choose a set for each turn. If the dice "
"do not match the chosen set rules then zero is scored for that set.<br/><br/"
